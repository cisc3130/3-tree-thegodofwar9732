# Program 3: Serialize a tree

Given the NTree class, write methods ```serialize``` and ```deserialize```, which write the tree to a text file and read it back.

Compile and test your code.

"foodtree.out" gives an example of a serialized format that is inefficient in time and space. Implement a better version for extra credit.
